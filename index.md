## C++

## Python
- [autocnet](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/autocnet): A library for the automated extraction and matching of image correspondences using computer vision and photogrammetry techniques. API Documentation is available [here](https://usgs-astrogeology.github.io/autocnet/).
- [plio](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/plio): Is a file i/o library, initially built upon GDAL that has since been expanded to support a wide range of planetary data sets. API documentation is available [here](https://usgs-astrogeology.github.io/plio).
- [plurmy](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/plurmy): At ASC we utilize a the Slurm workload manager on our cluster. We often want to submit jobs from without a python script. This library provides simple job submission functions.

## Docker
We utilize docker extensively for research tasks, development, and service deploys. Our images are stored under version control on GitHub and made available using [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/u/usgsastro/dashboard/).
- [miniflask](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/docker_miniflask): Is a template image that we build flask based web services on top of.


## Conda / Build / 3rd Party Dependencies
We utilize [anaconda cloud](https://anaconda.org/usgs-astrogeology/dashboard) to deploy many of our projects.
